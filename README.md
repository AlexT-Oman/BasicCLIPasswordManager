# BasicCLIPasswordManager
Ultra basic password manager made in C++ to practice with basic file I/O. All C++ in this file is self taught

The idea behind this project was to get more comfortable with the creation/deletion of files, parsing files and writing to files. I intentionally chose not to include encryption as I felt that exceeded the goal of this project.

If this project were to be remade to be actually useful I would want to add encryption and replace my current storage solution with SQLite.

I have only taken 1 semester in C++ the rest has been in Java so this project is to familize myself with C++ syntax again and relearn some subjects that haven't been touch a whole lot within my education so far.

Please note this project should be read as a starting point for me and I request this is used as a baseline when looking at any future projects
